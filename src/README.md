To run the code, simply compile and run the `Main` class.

To run the unit tests, use a JUnit test runner.

Note: This implementation uses the `Random` class to simulate the dice rolls. This is not suitable for production use, as it is not cryptographically secure. In a real-world implementation, you would want to use a more secure random number generator.
